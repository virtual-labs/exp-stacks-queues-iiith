      "question": "1. What will be the front and rear of an initially empty queue after the following operations - enqueue(2), enqueue(11), enqueue(3), dequeue(), enqueue(8), dequeue(), enqueue(5), dequeue()",
      "answers": {
        "a": "11,8",
        "b": "3,11",
        "c": "8,5",
        "d": "5,8"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. After the operations, 11 is not at the front and 8 is not at the rear.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 3 and 11 are not the correct front and rear after the given operations.",
        "c": "Correct. After all operations, the front is 8 and the rear is 5.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 5 is not at the front and 8 is not at the rear after the given operations."

    {
      "question": "2. You are given a simple queue with elements 2, 3, 8, 1, 9, 7 where 2 is the front of the queue. The elements are dequeued one-by-one and pushed into a stack, until the queue becomes empty. The elements are again popped from the stack one-by-one and enqueued into the original queue. What is the final arrangement of elements in the queue?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "7, 9, 1, 3, 8, 2",
        "b": "8, 1, 9, 7, 2, 3",
        "c": "9, 1, 8, 3, 2, 7",
        "d": "7, 9, 1, 8, 3, 2"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is not the correct order after reversing the queue using a stack.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is not the correct order after reversing the queue using a stack.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is not the correct order after reversing the queue using a stack.",
        "d": "Correct. The queue is reversed after the described operations, resulting in this order."

        "a": "1",
        "b": "3",
        "c": "2",
        "d": "Not possible"

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. At least two stacks are required to implement a queue.",
        "b": "Incorrect. More than two stacks are not required for this implementation.",
        "c": "Correct. Two stacks are required to implement a queue.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It is possible to implement a queue using two stacks."
