        "a": "Incorrect. 'LILO' and 'FILO' are not standard terms. The correct terms are LIFO (Last In First Out) for stacks and FIFO (First In First Out) for queues.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 'FILO' and 'LILO' are not standard terms. The correct terms are LIFO (Last In First Out) for stacks and FIFO (First In First Out) for queues.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The order should be LIFO for stacks and FIFO for queues, but the answer is not clearly matching the standard pairing.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Stack uses 1 pointer (top), Queue uses 2 pointers (front and rear).",

        "c": "Incorrect. The number of pointers is fixed for standard stack (1) and queue (2) implementations.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. It is not possible to implement a stack using only one queue.",
