      "question": "1. Which of these best describes an array?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A data structure that shows a hierarchical behaviour",
        "b": "Container of objects of similar types",
        "c": "Container of objects of mixed types",
        "d": "All of the mentioned"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The data structure that shows hierarchical behaviour is a tree, not an array.",
        "b": "Correct. An array is a container for objects of similar types.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A list can store mixed types, but an array cannot.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Only one of the mentioned answers describes an array."

      "question": "2. What is the time complexity of insertion at any point in an array?",

        "a": "O(N)",
        "b": "O(N^2)",
        "c": "O(NLogN)",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Inserting at any point in an array requires shifting elements, which is O(N).",
        "b": "Incorrect. Insertion in an array is not O(N^2).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Insertion in an array is not O(NLogN).",

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is a valid declaration of an integer array.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is a valid declaration of a character array.",
        "c": "Correct. This is not a valid array declaration in C/C++.",

      "question": "4. In a singly-linked list, each node contains a minimum of two fields. If one field is the data field to store the data, then the second field is _______.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Pointer to next value",
        "b": "Pointer to head node",

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The correct term is 'pointer to next node'.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Each node does not point to the head node.",
        "c": "Correct. Each node points to the next node in the list.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option c is the correct answer."

      "question": "5. What would be the asymptotic time complexity to add a tail element and to find an element in the linked list?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(n) and O(n)",
        "b": "O(1) and O(n)",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Both adding a tail element and finding an element in a singly linked list are O(n).",
        "b": "Incorrect. Adding a tail element is O(n) unless you maintain a tail pointer.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Finding an element is O(n) in a singly linked list.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Both operations are not O(1) in a singly linked list."

      "question": "6. Why do we need pointers in a linked list but not in an array?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Linked list can store any type of data",
        "b": "Data is not stored in contiguous locations in linked list",
        "c": "Array can only store elements of same type of data",
        "d": "Both a and c"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The need for pointers is not because of data type flexibility.",
        "b": "Correct. Pointers are needed because linked list nodes are not stored in contiguous memory.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is a property of arrays, not the reason for pointers in linked lists.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option b is the correct answer."
