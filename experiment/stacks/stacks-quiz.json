      "question": "1. Which among the following represents a stack?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "People waiting at a counter, where the action of popping is when someone has been served at the counter",
        "b": "A hand of bangles where pushing is wearing a new bangle",
        "c": "A pile of plates at a dinner party",
        "d": "People going around a merry-go-round"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is a queue, not a stack, as people are served in the order they arrive (FIFO).",
        "b": "Incorrect. Bangles are added and removed from the same end, but the analogy is less direct than a pile of plates.",
        "c": "Correct. A pile of plates is a classic example of a stack (LIFO).",
        "d": "Incorrect. A merry-go-round does not represent stack or queue behavior."

      "question": "2. What is the time complexity of push operation in a stack? What is the time complexity of pop operation in a stack?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(n), O(n)",
        "b": "O(1), O(n)",

      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Both push and pop operations in a stack are O(1) in standard implementations.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Both push and pop operations in a stack are O(1) in standard implementations.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Both push and pop operations in a stack are O(1) in standard implementations.",

      "question": "3. Consider these operations on an empty stack: push(3), push(5), pop(), push(10), push(11), pop(), push(100). What will be the stack configuration (first number is top of the stack, last is the bottom)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "100,10,3",
        "b": "3,5,10,11,100",

      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The stack after the operations will be [100, 10, 3] (top to bottom).",
        "b": "Incorrect. This does not match the stack configuration after the given operations.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This does not match the stack configuration after the given operations.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option a is the correct configuration."
