### Time Complexity

**Enqueue** : What would be the time for inserting an element into a queue? Time is constant O(1). **Dequeue** : Similar to insertion, deletion takes contant time O(1) too. **Search** : How much time would it take to search for a particular element inside a queue? Searching for a particular element would mean traversing the entire queue in the worst case, so search operation takes linear time O(n).
