### Applications of Stacks

   - **Expression Evaluation**
    Stack is used to evaluate prefix, postfix and infix expressions.
   - **Expression Conversion**
    An expression can be represented in prefix, postfix or infix notation. Stack can be used to convert one form of expression to another.
   - **Syntax Parsing**
    Many compilers use a stack for parsing the syntax of expressions, program blocks etc. before translating into low level code.
   - **Parenthesis Checking**
    Stack is used to check the proper opening and closing of parenthesis.
   - **String Reversal**
    Stack is used to reverse a string. We push the characters of string one by one into stack and then pop characters from stack.

### Applications of Queues

   - **Serving Requests**
   - Serving requests on a single shared resource, like a printer, CPU task scheduling etc.
   - In real life scenario, Call Center phone systems uses Queues to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free.
    Handling of interrupts in real-time systems. The interrupts are handled in the same order as they arrive i.e First come first served.
